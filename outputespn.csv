Top LLWS Moments: Winners console LLWS star who ceded walk-off

The 2017 Little League World Series has been filled with highlights: a perfect game; dramatic, walk-off hits; big leaguers and Little Leaguers and a heartfelt moment of compassion between competitors. Here are some of the most memorable moments so far from Williamsport.

Every August, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, is the mecca for Little League baseball players from around the world who dream of playing professional baseball. This year, those dreamers were treated to a taste of the real thing. The first MLB Little League Classic showcased divisional rivals the St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates for a regular-season game at BB&T Ballpark at Historic Bowman Field.

Little League lessons: Major leaguers on childhood advice

Today's major league stars started as children with dreams. So what have they taken with them from those early days when they were just learning the game? Experiences that carried them from Little League fields to big league parks. Stephen Courtney (7) is one of three players from last year's Australia team who is returning to Williamsport in 2017.

• FAQ's about going to Williamsport

Qualification

The qualification process for the Little League World Series begins in the months before the tournament, when each local Little League program puts together an all-star team within its league. That team goes on to compete in district, sectional and state tournaments, most of which are double-elimination. The state champions (each state sends two teams) go on to a regional competition, broken up into eight regions:

New England, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Great Lakes, Midwest, Northwest, Southwest and West. Eight divisions also compete in the international bracket: Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Latin America, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Europe-Middle East-Africa and Trans-Atlantic. More than 7,000 teams -- 6,500 in the U.S. -- participate in the tournament, with 6,500 of them eliminated within the first three weeks.

World Series Format

The Little League World Series is contested by 16 teams: the eight winners of the regional tournaments and eight international champions. In 2010, the tournament was determined by double elimination for the first time. The two brackets (the U.S. and international brackets) are divided into two pools. The winner of each pool goes on to a single-elimination championship game within its bracket. Then the U.S. and international champions compete for the World Series title in the championship game.

Each team still will play at least three games -- the four teams that lose both games in their pool will play a consolation match against an international team that also dropped out in two games.

Eligibility

Players in the Little League World Series must be between the ages of 11 and 13. Players must provide birth certificates to show they are of age. The birth-date cutoff -- the earliest date that players could turn 13 -- is May. That means many of the players in the later rounds of the tournament have already turned 13.

Girls are allowed to participate in the Little League World Series, although there also is a separate softball World Series. Girls were not allowed to participate in Little League until 1974, when the rules were revised to allow inclusion. Little League's softball programs were created the same year. Victoria Roche was the first girl to play in a Little League World Series, in the 1984 competition for the Brussels (Belgium) international squad. The 2004 tournament marked the first time two girls played in the same World Series (it happened again in 2009).",8.710000,8.070000,0.0,Zach Lowe,http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0821%2Fr247338_1072x603_16%2D9.jpg,2017-12-15,2017-12-15

NBA Power Rankings -- Our expert panel unveils its rankings for Week 9,2017-12-10,http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21731935/nba-power-rankings-our-expert-panel-unveils-rankings-week-9,"As the Golden State Warriors are proving they can keep winning without the injured Stephen Curry, both the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs are keeping pace as the trio of teams starts to separate themselves from the pack out West. And speaking of pace, there's something brewing in Indiana as Victor Oladipo is showing the Indiana Pacers that life after Paul George -- who visits his old team this week -- isn't so bad after all.

Every Monday throughout the regular season, our panel (this week: ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz, Adam Reisinger and Ramona Shelburne, The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears and FiveThirtyEight's Chris Herring) will rank the league's 30 teams from top to bottom, with research notes on each team provided by ESPN Stats & Information.

Previous rankings: Week 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1

1. Houston Rockets

2017-18 record: 20-4

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 1 2-0 NO, CHA, SA, MIL

There's far more to Chris Paul's playmaking than simply pointing toward his assist totals. The Rockets are shooting 61 percent directly off passes from Paul so far this season, according to Second Spectrum. That's the best in the NBA among the more than 125 players who have made at least 100 passes leading directly to a shot. -- Micah Adams

2. Golden State Warriors

2017-18 record: 21-6

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 3 3-0 POR, DAL

The Warriors' 6-0 road trip was the first time in franchise history they swept a trip of at least six games. They are now home for nine of the next 10 and do not leave the state of California until after the new year. Can they win out entering the Christmas clash with Cleveland? BPI gives Golden State a 52 percent chance of winning its next six games, which would put the defending champs on a 12-game winning streak entering the NBA Finals rematch. -- Micah Adams

3. Boston Celtics

2017-18 record: 23-5

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 2 3-1 @CHI, DEN, UTAH, @MEM

Al Horford has been worth every penny this season, at least per ESPN's real plus-minus, in which he ranked seventh in the NBA entering Sunday. Horford ranked 14th among power forwards last season. This season he's second, ahead of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Anthony Davis and trailing only Draymond Green. And Horford's passing has been on point: The Celtics are 10-0 when he records at least six assists. -- Mark Simon

4. San Antonio Spurs

2017-18 record: 19-8

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 5 4-0 @DAL, @HOU, DAL

While everyone else is busy choosing a side in the ""can Houston beat Golden State"" discussion, the Spurs are quietly just two games behind the Warriors and on the verge of getting back Kawhi Leonard. At the heart of San Antonio staying in the thick of the race atop the Western Conference is the play of LaMarcus Aldridge, currently sporting a career-high player efficiency rating of 25.3. -- Micah Adams

5. Cleveland Cavaliers

2017-18 record: 19-8

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 4 3-1 ATL, LAL, UTAH, @WAS

LeBron James currently leads the NBA in points scored and assisted in the clutch this season, and it's an area he holds a distinct advantage over James Harden as the two have started to build some separation from the rest of the MVP pack. James has scored or assisted on 77 percent of Cleveland's clutch-time points, compared to 50 percent for Harden in Houston. -- Micah Adams

6. Toronto Raptors

2017-18 record: 17-7

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 6 3-0 @LAC, @PHX, BKN, SAC

The Raptors' two best players have each improved significantly in a specific phase of their games. Kyle Lowry is averaging 6.5 rebounds per game after never averaging five in a season. The Raptors are 15-3 when he grabs five or more boards and 2-4 when he doesn't. DeMar DeRozan is averaging 5.1 assists per game, also a career high. The Raptors are 13-1 when he has five or more assists this season and 4-6 when he doesn't. -- Vincent Johnson

7. Milwaukee Bucks

2017-18 record: 15-10

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 12 3-1 @NO, CHI, @HOU

The Greek Freak's dunk on Rudy Gobert might have been the play of the week and continued what has been a season-long string of posterizations for Giannis Antetokounmpo. According to Second Spectrum, he has more contested dunks than any other player in the league this season while an NBA-best 32 different defenders have been victimized. -- Micah Adams

8. Minnesota Timberwolves

2017-18 record: 16-11

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 9 2-1 PHI, SAC, PHX

Taj Gibson has gotten more minutes this season than he ever has, and for good reason: He leads the team in net rating. The Timberwolves are a far better team at both defending and rebounding when Gibson is on the floor. He's scoring some too. He just came off a three-game stretch in which he averaged 16.7 points. -- Mark Simon

9. Indiana Pacers

2017-18 record: 16-11

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 16 4-0 OKC, DET, @BKN

The Pacers ended the week in a big way, with a win over the streaking Cavaliers on Friday and an overtime win featuring Victor Oladipo's 47-point performance on Sunday. The Pacers defeated a Cavs team that had won 13 straight, the sixth time in franchise history Indiana had won a game against a team that entered with a winning streak of 13 or more games since they joined the NBA in 1976. -- Sarah Langs

10. Denver Nuggets

2017-18 record: 14-12

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 10 1-3 @DET, @BOS, NO

Gary Harris ranks third in the NBA in real plus-minus among shooting guards (two spots better than Klay Thompson). Why? The Nuggets are 8.4 points per 100 possessions better with him on the court than off on offense and 5.3 points per 100 possessions better on defense. -- Mark Simon

11. Detroit Pistons

2017-18 record: 14-12

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 7 0-4 DEN, @ATL, @IND, ORL

The Pistons are showing they may not be able to hang with the NBA's big boys, dropping six straight with losses to the Spurs, Warriors and Celtics among them. The problem Detroit has against these teams? It just can't score. The Pistons are shooting 40.8 percent from the field this month (worst in the NBA) and scoring 96.8 points per 100 possessions (second-worst in the NBA). -- Mark Simon

12. Philadelphia 76ers

2017-18 record: 13-13

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 8 0-3 @MIN, OKC

Ben Simmons added his third career triple-double to his résumé on Thursday in the 76ers' loss to the Lakers . With his next triple-double this season, Simmons would tie Jason Kidd (1994-95) for fifth-most triple-doubles by a rookie in a season, according to research by Elias Sports Bureau. It should come as no surprise that the leader of that rookie triple-doubles list is Oscar Robertson, with 26 in the 1960-61 season. -- Sarah Langs

13. Washington Wizards

2017-18 record: 14-12

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 13 2-2 @BKN, MEM, LAC, CLE

Bradley Beal's clutch-time numbers are disconcerting. He's 9-of-36 for the season, and his 25 percent field goal percentage is third-lowest among those with at least 15 such shots taken. Beal made one to put the Wizards ahead of the Clippers late in Saturday's game, ending a streak of 10 straight misses. But there was no reward, as Lou Williams beat the Wizards with a clutch shot of his own. -- Mark Simon

14. Portland Trail Blazers

2017-18 record: 13-12

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 11 0-2 @GS, @MIA, @ORL, @CHA

After suffering a fourth straight loss, the Trail Blazers embark on a five-game road trip in which they visit the Warriors, Heat, Magic, Hornets and Timberwolves before returning home to face the Spurs. Portland, however, may be able to withstand it, as its 6-4 record on the road is better than its 7-8 home mark. -- Mark Simon

15. Oklahoma City Thunder

2017-18 record: 12-13

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 14 2-1 CHA, @IND, @PHI, @NYK

In Saturday's win over Memphis, Russell Westbrook notched his 34th triple-double of 2017, which tied Oscar Robertson for the most in a calendar year in league history. However, we'd be remiss if it came without mentioning the fact that he also shot 7-for-29. Since the start of last season, Westbrook has 14 triple-doubles in which he also missed more than 15 shots. The rest of the NBA has combined for two of them. -- Micah Adams

16. Utah Jazz

2017-18 record: 13-14

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 15 0-3 @CHI, @BOS, @CLE

It's amazing how quickly a six-game win streak can feel like a lifetime ago. After dropping three straight, Utah looks ahead at a daunting December schedule that is the hardest month any team will face all season, according to BPI. That includes a four-game gauntlet against Boston, Cleveland, Houston and Oklahoma City to close out the current six-game road trip. Utah's final nine games to close out 2017 is the hardest nine-game stretch any team will face all season. -- Micah Adams

17. New Orleans Pelicans

2017-18 record: 14-13

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 17 2-2 @HOU, MIL, @DEN

The Pelicans scored 44 points in the fourth quarter on Sunday against the 76ers, which was tied for the most points scored in a single quarter in franchise history. Earlier in the week, DeMarcus Cousins became the third player with multiple 40-point, 20-rebound games in a season over the past 40 seasons, the first player to accomplish that since Patrick Ewing in 1989-90. -- Harrison Marder

18. Miami Heat

2017-18 record: 12-13

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 19 1-1 @MEM, POR, @CHA, LAC

You probably wouldn't guess this, but the Heat are the NBA's best in clutch-time field goal percentage this season, shooting 56.5 percent. That's paced by Dion Waiters, who is 17-of-28 in clutch time. His 60.7 percent field goal percentage ranks second to Boston's Jayson Tatum among those who have taken at least such 15 shots this season. -- Mark Simon

19. New York Knicks

Doug McDermott has been a nice acquisition for the Knicks, as New York is 9-3 this season when he scores at least eight points. McDermott is one missed shot away from shooting 50 percent from the field this season. With Tim Hardaway Jr. out, they'll need scoring wherever they can get it. They got 23 points in 31 minutes off the bench from Dougie McBuckets in Sunday's win. -- Mark Simon

Brandon Ingram has fared well with Lonzo Ball on the court this season. Ingram is shooting 47 percent when paired with Ball and 39 percent when on the floor without him. Ingram had his biggest basket with Ball assisting last week: the last-second 3-pointer that beat the 76ers. -- David Gordon

Nikola Vucevic has been shooting better than he ever has from 2-point range. Per Second Spectrum, he's hitting at 76 percent in the restricted area after shooting 63 percent last season. Saturday, Vucevic became the first Magic player with at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a game since Tracy McGrady in February 2003. -- Mark Simon and James Howat

Dwight Howard turned back the clock on Friday against the Bulls with 25 points, 20 rebounds and six blocks, becoming the first player in Bobcats/Hornets history to accomplish that trio of feats in a single game. Unfortunately, his monster effort was not enough as the Hornets ended up losing to the Bulls at home by eight points in overtime. -- Harrison Marder

23. LA Clippers

2017-18 record: 9-15

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 22 1-1 TOR, @ORL, @WAS, @ MIA

The Clippers' 9-15 record is the team's worst 24-game start since 2010-11 (5-19). But there was a bright spot this weekend from Lou Williams, who hit a game-winning 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds to go in Saturday's game. Prior to Saturday, Williams was 0-of-10 on potential game-winning field goal attempts in the last two seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. It was also his second game this season with at least 35 points off the bench. He's the only player in the NBA with more than one such game this season. -- Sarah Langs

2017-18 record: 10-15

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 24 2-1 WAS, NYK, @TOR, IND

The Nets acquired 2015 No. 3 overall pick Jahlil Okafor from the 76ers this past week. After dealing for D'Angelo Russell this summer, the Nets have traded for the Nos. 2 and 3 picks in the 2015 NBA draft. The Nets made two picks of their own in that draft: Chris McCullough with the 29th pick and Pat Connaughton with the 41st pick. They traded Connaughton on draft night and McCullough in February 2017 after just 38 career games with Brooklyn. -- Sarah Langs

Zach Randolph had a vintage performance on Friday against the Pelicans, pouring in a season-high 35 points with 13 rebounds in an overtime victory. It was Randolph's first game with at least 35 points and 10 rebounds since 2012. Z-Bo is averaging 23.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in his past five games. -- Harrison Marder

2017-18 record: 8-18

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 25 1-3 MIA, @WAS, ATL, BOS

The Grizzlies are in the midst of a brutal stretch having lost 14 of their past 15 games. During this free fall, they've held a double-digit lead in six of the contests ... and lost them all. Overall, Memphis is 5-8 when leading by 10 or more points this season. They were 34-7 in those games last season. -- Vincent Johnson

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 28 1-3 SA, @GS, @SA

The Mavericks' loss Sunday night to the Timberwolves was Dirk Nowitzki's 65th regular-season game against Minnesota, the most for any player. It was the 1,421st game of Nowitzki's career, three behind Kevin Willis for No. 6 on the NBA's all-time list. -- ESPN Stats & Information

29. Atlanta Hawks

2017-18 record: 6-20

PREV. RANK LAST WEEK THIS WEEK 29 1-3 @CLE, DET, @MEM

The Hawks are 6-20, their worst 26-game start since 2004-05 when they started 5-21 and their second-worst start since moving to Atlanta before the 1968-69 season. One reason why? Not much defense: This season, the Hawks are 26th in defensive efficiency after ranking fourth leaguewide in 2016-17. -- Sarah Langs

Break up the Bulls! After blowing a 16-point fourth-quarter lead against the Pacers, the Bulls bounced back with their first back-to-back wins of the season. The wins have coincided with the return of Nikola Mirotic, who scored a team-high 19 points off the bench in just 20 minutes in Saturday's win over the Knicks. -- Micah Adams",8.570000,6.120000,0.0,Zach Lowe,http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1210%2Fnba_week9_16x9.jpg,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
