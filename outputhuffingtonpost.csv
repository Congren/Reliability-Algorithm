Trump Benefited From The ‘Chain Migration’ He Blamed For Attempted New York Terror Attack,2017-12-10,http://huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-chain-migration-enriched-donald-trumps-life_us_5a32a81ee4b00dbbcb5ba69a?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,"President Donald Trump used the attempted New York terrorist attack this week to renew his call to end “chain migration.” That’s the term immigration restrictionists use to describe allowing U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to help their family members immigrate to this country.

The president and his allies insist ― without evidence ― that this kind of immigration is a threat to the nation because it lets in suspect people. They argue that limiting Americans’ ability to bring in family members will help prevent attacks like Monday’s incident, which was allegedly perpetrated by a legal permanent resident from Bangladesh whose uncle, a U.S. citizen, had sponsored him to come to the U.S. in 2011. (The investigation so far suggests he became radicalized some years later.)

The fact is that Trump, like millions of other Americans, has personally benefited from the same sort of migration he now decries.

If the U.S. didn’t allow immigrants to follow their family members, Trump might have led a poorer and lonelier life. Some of his ancestors might not have come to the U.S. to join family, long the most common form of immigration. His in-laws’ options for joining his wife, herself an immigrant from Slovenia, in the U.S. would have been notably limited. His businesses could not have hired certain talented workers. And the president himself might not have been born in the U.S. at all.

Trump’s ancestors followed family members to the U.S.

Carlos Barria/Reuters President Donald Trump, who is a beneficiary of ""chain migration,"" delivers a speech on tax reform legislation at the White House in Washington on Dec. 13, 2017.

Trump backs the RAISE Act, a bill from Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) that would restrict U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents from requesting family-based immigrant visas for anybody but their spouses and minor children. This would make it much harder for them to bring over their adult children, siblings or parents to reunite with them in the U.S.

Trump’s grandfather and mother both followed their siblings to this country. The president’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, left Germany in 1885. His sister had already immigrated to New York and settled in a Manhattan enclave known at the time as Kleindeutschland, or Little Germany. The president’s Scottish-born mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, also followed family to New York, joining two sisters in the city in 1929, according to The New Yorker.

Migrants like Friedrich and Mary Anne didn’t need their family members to sponsor them for immigrant visas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the U.S. had a liberal policy of admitting European settlers. But migrating to join siblings or other relatives, as Trump’s ancestors did, is precisely the phenomenon the president has repeatedly pledged to end.

Trump’s in-laws followed their daughter Melania to the U.S.

Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Donald Trump's mother and grandfather followed their siblings to the U.S., while Melania Trump's parents followed her.

If it becomes law, the RAISE Act could also block Trump’s in-laws from officially immigrating ― if they have not done so already. According to news reports, first lady Melania Trump’s parents live at least a significant part of the year in New York, where they reside at Trump Tower. Her sister, Ines Knauss, also lives in New York.

Immigration records are private in the United States. A spokeswoman for the first lady said the office does “not comment on the First Lady’s family in an effort to protect their privacy,” and the White House did not respond to a request for comment on how the president’s ancestors immigrated to the U.S.

David Wildes, an immigration lawyer who currently represents Melania Trump on immigration issues, likewise declined to comment on the status of her immediate relatives.

Assuming the first lady’s parents are still visitors, family reunification wouldn’t be their only option for taking up full-time residence in America. Investing $1 million in this country or sinking $500,000 into an enterprise that creates at least 10 jobs would qualify them for an EB-5 investor visa. If one of them showed “extraordinary ability” in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics, they might qualify for a green card on those merits ― as Melania Knauss did when she applied to become a legal permanent resident in 2001 to pursue a modeling career. If the first lady’s parents faced persecution in their home country of Slovenia, they might qualify for refugee status.

But the main reason Viktor and Amalija Knavs are living in the United States, according to multiple reports, is to care for their daughter’s child. That’s exactly the logic that drives U.S. immigration law to privilege family reunification. From the day Melania Trump took her oath of citizenship in 2006, she could have petitioned for her parents to immigrate to the United States. Even if she chose not to sponsor her parents for permanent residence, the law affords multiple ways to bring her family here for extended periods.

“It appears that Trump’s own family takes advantage of the immigration system when it suits them,” immigration attorney David Leopold told HuffPost. “And it’s completely hypocritical for Trump to then turn around and blame all immigrants for a horrible attack in New York that occured years after this guy got here.”

“Chain migration” has helped Trump’s businesses.

The president’s companies have also benefited from the policy he blamed for Monday’s attack. Trump’s modeling and Miss Universe businesses attracted top foreign candidates with the lure that they could also bring relatives to the U.S., according to Wildes, the immigration attorney who represented those two enterprises for more than a decade.

During that time, Wildes said, he processed hundreds of visa applications. More often than not, he said, negotiating green cards or work authorization for the employee’s family members was part of the deal.

“It’s hard to find talent,” Wildes told HuffPost. “And when they find talent, they generally want to negotiate family members to make sure their lives are more robust and meaningful. … Say we’re soliciting a visa for somebody and that person says, ‘I’m only going to come if you sponsor a visa for myself and green cards for my whole family so I can resettle here.’”

Wildes, a Democrat, called Trump’s comments after Monday’s terrorist attack “well-intended,” but disputed the idea that family-sponsored immigration should be blamed for such crimes.

“We have always appreciated the good cheer and solicitation of talent coming to the United States, including family members of those people so that they would be more motivated to work,” Wildes said. “This whole notion of ‘chain migration’ being negative is a new phenomenon and this vocabulary is emanating from people that are xenophobic and do not have a proud sense of our immigration legacy.”",8.280000,7.910000,0.0,Roque Planas,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a32a886150000490049bb0f.jpeg?cache=jaw2e8fqmp&ops=1910_1000,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
Omarosa Says Donald Trump Is 'Racial' But 'Not A Racist’,2017-12-10,http://huffingtonpost.com/entry/omarosa-donald-trump-racial-not-racist_us_5a33e557e4b040881be9f178?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,"Omarosa Manigault Newman said that she believes President Donald Trump isn’t a racist.

In an interview with ABC’s “Nightline” on Thursday night, following her White House exit earlier in the week, the ex-communications director in the White House’s Office of Public Liaison told host Deborah Roberts that some of the things Trump does may be racially charged but that it doesn’t make him a racist.

“Donald Trump is racial, but he is not a racist,” the former “Apprentice” star said of the president who in August defended the “very fine people on both sides” during the Charlottesville white nationalist rally.

“The things that he says, the types of pushback that he gives, involve people of color. These are racial exchanges,” Newman said. “Yes, I will acknowledge many of the exchanges — particularly in the last six months — have been racially charged. Do we then just stop and label him as a racist? No.”

Newman, who was the only black senior adviser to the president, also acknowledged the lack of diversity in the White House, noting that often times she felt “lonely.”

“I regret that we haven’t reached the level of diversity in this administration that I strove to see,” she said.

Since turning in her resignation on Tuesday, Newman has spoken with several news outlets to tell her story. On Thursday, she denied reports in an interview with “Good Morning America’s” Michael Strahan that White House chief of staff John Kelly fired her. After the segment aired, co-anchor Robin Roberts took a slight dig at Newman by saying “Bye, Felicia” on air.",7.640000,7.540000,0.0,Taryn Finley,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a33fcb41600004700c50314.jpeg?ops=1910_1000,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Announce Their Wedding Date,2017-12-10,http://huffingtonpost.com/entry/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-announce-their-wedding-date_us_5a33c929e4b01d429cc7f646?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,"Kensington Palace announced Friday that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle plan to marry on May 19, 2018.

“Today’s announcement follows earlier confirmation of the month of the wedding and its location at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle,” reads a tweet from Kensington Palace.

His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales and Ms. Meghan Markle will marry on 19th May 2018.

Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, followed a similar wedding timeline. The two got engaged in November 2010 and were married five months later, on April 29, 2011. Harry and Markle most likely chose to wed in May because William and Kate are expected to welcome their third child in April.

While William and Kate were married at Westminster Abbey, Harry and Markle have opted to marry at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. Though it’s a much smaller location, it’s extremely meaningful to the couple.

“Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,” Kensington Palace said in a statement in November.

The couple’s decision to get married at St George’s Chapel shows just how serious they are about a religious wedding, according to Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury and the head of England’s state church.

“This is no tick-box exercise,” Welby told BBC Radio 4′s “Today” program on Thursday. “There is a profound sense of commitment [and] seriousness, both about faith and about their lives together, which is quite inspirational.”

Before getting married, Markle ― who was raised as a Protestant ― will reportedly be baptized and confirmed into the Church of England.

The 33-year-old royal and the 36-year-old American actor announced their engagement in November. They’ve dated for a little over a year.

In an interview with the BBC, Harry said the proposal occurred during a “standard, typical night” for the two.

“What were we doing? Just roasting chicken ― trying to roast a chicken,” Markle said. “It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee.”

She added, “I could barely let you finish proposing. I was like, ‘Can I say yes now?’”",9.400000,8.190000,0.0,Carly Ledbetter,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a33cbc41600000d12cf1616.jpeg?cache=vkuv0guyjd&ops=1910_1000,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
Donald Trump Jr. Doesn't Seem To Know His Dad Appointed The FCC Head,2017-12-10,http://huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-fcc-twitter-net-neutrality_us_5a332097e4b040881be91822?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,"Donald Trump Jr. managed to spread some fake news Thursday on Twitter.

The president’s son used the platform to criticize supporters of net neutrality after the Federal Communications Commission repealed the Title II protections that kept the internet a public utility. Unfortunately, Trump Jr. doesn’t seem to have all the facts in order.

“I would pay good money to see all those people complaining about Obama’s FCC chairman voting to repeal #NetNeutality actually explain it in detail,” Trump Jr. wrote. “I’d also bet most hadn’t heard of it before this week. #outrage.”

Net neutrality rules were initially put in place to ensure that internet service providers, ISPs, treated all information and content across the web equally. Repealing the Title II protections would allow internet service providers, such as Verizon or Comcast, to decide what content would be blocked or offered at slower speeds in favor of the company’s own content.

Critics of Pai’s repeal effort fear that ISPs will discriminate against internet traffic and charge companies such as Netflix or Amazon exorbitant fees to give consumers efficient access to those services.

(HuffPost’s parent company, Oath, is owned by Verizon. HuffPost is also represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which supports net neutrality and opposed its repeal).

Millions of Americans had protested Pai’s plan to repeal net neutrality regulations. Citizens have protested to keep the rules in place, in addition to calling offices of public officials to protect the internet. Congress could nullify the FCC decision with a Congressional Review Act resolution, and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said Thursday that he would introduced one, but it’s considered a long shot.

More than 20 U.S. senators attempted to delay Thursday’s vote after suspecting that the FCC was flooded with fraudulent comments, especially those in favor of the repeal. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman opened an investigation, which showed that up to 2 million comments were submitted under false names.

Schneiderman announced that he would sue to prevent the rollbacks on Thursday. In a YouTube video, Schneiderman criticized the FCC’s lack of assistance in his office’s investigation and called the vote a travesty.",8.620000,9.090000,0.0,Doha Madani,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a33211c150000490049bc94.jpeg?cache=xhslbhuajm&ops=1910_1000,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
'Harlem Shake' Creators Threaten Legal Action Against FCC Chairman Ajit Pai,2017-12-10,http://huffingtonpost.com/entry/harlem-shake-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai_us_5a33d5e6e4b0ff955ad225e4?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,"The brains behind the viral hit “Harlem Shake” are threatening legal action against Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai for his use of the song in an advertisement for the repeal of net neutrality rules.

After famed DJ Diplo tweeted at the song’s producer Harry Rodrigues ― a DJ better known as Baauer ― about Pai’s use of the song, Rodrigues tweeted on Thursday afternoon that he’d be “taking action.”

I'm Taking action. Whatever I can do to stop this loser https://t.co/Ajo6wBATdF — Aa (@baauer) December 14, 2017

In collaboration with conservative news outlet The Daily Caller, Pai released a video entitled “7 Things You Can Still Do On The Internet After Net Neutrality” that, at one point, features him dancing to the 2013 song. The video went out just one day before the FCC voted to repeal the Obama-era regulations currently in effect.

Baauer gave a statement to Billboard Dance about the use of his song without his permission, saying that it “obviously comes as a surprise to me as it was just brought to my attention.”

“I want to be clear that it was used completely without my consent or council. My team and I are currently exploring every single avenue available to get it taken down. I support Net Neutrality like the vast majority of this country and am appalled to be associated with its repeal in anyway.”

In addition to Baauer, the record label responsible for “Harlem Shake,” Mad Decent, also tweeted that they do not “approve of the message contained therein” and would be pursuing “further legal action if it is not removed.”
