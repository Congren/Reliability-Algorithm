Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to marry on 19 May 2018,2017-12-10,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42369780,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The couple announced their engagement in November

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding will be held on Saturday 19 May 2018, Kensington Palace has announced.

The pair confirmed their engagement in November and said the service would be at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.

The date breaks with tradition as royal weddings usually take place on a weekday - the Queen wed on a Thursday and the Duke of Cambridge on a Friday.

The wedding will be on the same day as the FA Cup Final, which Prince William normally attends as FA president.

The time of the match has yet to be confirmed, but in recent years it has taken place at 17:30 GMT.

The Royal Family will pay for the wedding, including the service, music, flowers and reception.

The event will take place just a month after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to welcome their third child to the family.

Ms Markle will be baptised into the Church of England and confirmed before the wedding.

Earlier this week, Kensington Palace announced the couple will be spending Christmas together at Sandringham with the Queen.

The prince and the American actor, 36, carried out their first official engagement in Nottingham on 1 December.

Prince Harry made a public appearance at Sandhurst earlier on Friday - 11 years after he graduated from the military academy - for the Sovereign's Parade.

No Bank Holiday

BBC Royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the Saturday date was ""unusual, but not unprecedented"" and would give people the opportunity to go to Windsor for the celebrations.

He added: ""Downing Street clearly hasn't been persuaded [into giving a Bank Holiday]… these things are so ruled by precedent.""

Reacting to the clash with the cup match, an FA spokesman said the organisation was ""delighted"" for Prince Harry and Ms Markle.

He added: ""Saturday 19 May promises to be a wonderful day with such a special royal occasion being followed by English football's showpiece event, the Emirates FA Cup Final.

""With millions coming together to watch both events at home and around the world, it will be a day to celebrate.""

Missing British explorer Christian Velten: Africa sightings,2017-12-10,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-42356550,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sister of missing man says she had to think of him as dead to get on with life

The sister of a British explorer who went missing in Africa 14 years ago is still hoping he will get home to the UK after he was reportedly seen begging.

Hannah Velten said there had been a reported sighting of her brother Christian in Ghana, in 2005.

A man was described in a Facebook message as being confused and thin, but asking for money to buy a ticket home.

Since then, a further sighting in 2015 reported him as having settled in Africa with a girlfriend.

That last confirmed sighting of Mr Velten was in Nairobi, Kenya.

Ms Velten said her family had, at one time, given up hope of ever seeing him again.

""I had to get on with my life. I had to think of him as dead,"" she said.

After successive appeals to find him, Ms Velten, who lives near Herstmonceux, East Sussex, set up the Searching for Chris Velten Facebook page in 2016.

She later received a message reporting the sighting of a white man begging at traffic lights in Accra, Ghana, in 2005. The correspondent said the man was looking for his family.

Ms Velten said the man had been described as dirty, bruised and looking as if he had just left hospital.

It led the family to believe he might have had an accident or been attacked and lost his memory, she said.

She told the BBC the family had not flown out to search for her brother because it would be like looking for ""a needle in a haystack"".

Mr Velten, who was a seasoned traveller, had set out to retrace the steps of 18th Century explorer Mungo Park in March 2003, aged 27.

His last phone call home came from Kita in Mali on 23 March, but a search party sent out to the country that October established sightings of him further up the River Niger in Bamako.

Mother-of-two Ms Velten said: ""We still miss him like hell.""

She has made a fresh appeal to her brother to make contact.

""Come home or get in touch,"" she said. ""That's all we want.""",6.930000,8.070000,0.0,doesn't exist,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05r6nnz.jpg,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
Vodafone offers thousands early contract exit,2017-12-10,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42367751,"Image copyright Getty Images

Thousands of Vodafone customers will be able to end their contracts early after the UK's communications regulator raised concerns over new charges.

In April, Vodafone introduced new international roaming charges for 60 countries outside the European Union, and told customers via text message.

Ofcom said it had ""intervened"" because it had ""concerns about the clarity of that text message"".

In a statement, Vodafone said its customers ""like"" its products.

Vodafone's Roam Further charges, introduced in 2017, mean customers on a monthly contract are charged a flat fee of £6 per day to use their phone in 60 countries including the US, Canada and Russia.

The changes mean customers will be charged the flat £6 fee even if they only send one text message.

Previously customers were charged for their usage and fees varied between countries.

'Bill shock'

Ofcom considered that light users would be more affected by the changes because ""they could no longer send texts, make calls or use data on a 'pay-per-use' basis'"".

Mobile phone networks must give customers 30 days' notice of any contract changes likely to be of ""material detriment"", and must let customers end their contracts without penalty if they do not agree to the changes.

Some customers had complained and Ofcom said it was concerned that Vodafone's communication had not been clear.

It said right to exit information should be provided ""in the main body of the text or email"" rather than linking to a separate webpage as Vodafone had done.

In response to Ofcom's concerns, Vodafone sent another message to affected customers and gave them a further 30 days to leave their contract.

It said it had identified 55,000 customers who were likely to face ""material detriment"" following the introduction of the new charges.

In a statement, Vodafone said Roam Further ""removes the fear of bill shock"".

Brexit: EU leaders agree to move talks to next stage,2017-12-10,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42368096,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit: Theresa May says agreement is ""important step"" on the road to Brexit

EU leaders have agreed to move Brexit talks on to the second phase but called for ""further clarity"" from the UK about the future relationship it wants.

The first issue to be discussed, early next year, will be the details of an expected two-year transition period after the UK's exit in March 2019.

Talks on trade and security co-operation are set to follow in March.

Theresa May hailed an ""important step"" on the road but Germany's Angela Merkel said it would get ""even tougher"".

Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, broke the news that the 27 EU leaders were happy to move on to phase two after they met in Brussels.

He congratulated Mrs May on reaching this stage and said the EU would begin internal preparations for the next phase right now as well as ""exploratory contacts with the UK to get more clarity on their vision"".

While securing a deal in time for the UK's exit in March 2019 was realistic, he suggested that the next phase would be ""more challenging and more demanding"".

Mrs May said the two sides would begin discussions on future relations straight away and hoped for ""rapid progress"" on a transitional phase to ""give certainty"" to business.

""This is an important step on the road to delivering the smooth and orderly Brexit that people voted for in June 2016,"" she said.

""The UK and EU have shown what can be achieved with commitment and perseverance on both sides.""

Labour's international trade spokesman, Barry Gardiner, welcomed the move forward, but said it would be a ""real problem"" for business if the EU didn't start talking trade for a further three months.

He also said his party would not put a time limit on a post-Brexit transition phase, as the expected two-year period would be ""extremely tight"".

The EU has published its guidelines for phase two of the negotiations, with discussions on future economic co-operation not likely to begin until March.

The three-page document says the UK will remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and be required to permit freedom of movement during any transition period.

And agreements on the Irish border, the so-called divorce bill and the rights of EU and UK citizens, agreed by Mrs May last Friday, must be ""respected in full and translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible"".

The document says: ""As the UK will continue to participate in the customs union and the single market during the transition, it will have to continue to comply with EU trade policy.""

While the EU is willing to engage in ""preliminary and preparatory discussions"" on trade as part of building a ""close partnership"" after the UK's departure, this means any formal agreement ""can only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country"".

Phew for PM

By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg

After the six months she has had, Theresa May might be entitled to breathe a sigh of relief, as the European Council officially declared that the first phase of our long goodbye from the European Union is over.

Stand back from the daily dramas and perhaps it was always bound to happen.

Both sides are committed to getting an agreement.

The EU and the UK both want a deal to be done, and while there has, inevitably, been grumpiness on both sides, they have, in the main, dealt with each other in good faith.

The document ""calls on the UK to provide further clarity on its position on the framework for the future relationship"".

But in a passage added during the past week, it invites the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to ""continue internal preparatory discussions"" on future relations rather than having to wait until March to do so.

Another rebellion headed off?

Sources have told the BBC that the government is highly likely to accept an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill next week to see off another potential Commons defeat for Theresa May.

Conservative rebels have been concerned about plans to put the Brexit date and time - 11pm on 29 March 2019 - into law.

Backbenchers, including former minister Oliver Letwin, have tabled an amendment, suggesting a change to the legislation.

Ministers are likely to accept their plan, which is a change that some of the potential rebels have been asking for, the BBC understands.

Senior sources are confident they can see off a defeat, after No 10 said there were no plans to take the date out of the bill.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU's initial priority was to ""formalise the agreement"" that had already been reached before moving forward, adding ""the second phase will be significantly harder and the first was very difficult"".

Praising Mrs May as a ""tough, smart and polite"" negotiator, he said he was ""entirely convinced"" that the final agreement reached would be approved by the UK and European Parliaments.

Giving his response, French President Emmanuel Macron said that in moving forward the EU had maintained its unity, protected the integrity of the single market and ensured ""compliance with our own rules"".
