German teen ISIS bride reunites with her mom before trial,2017-12-10,https://nypost.com/2017/12/15/german-teen-isis-bride-reunites-with-her-mom-before-trial/,"A German schoolgirl-turned-jihadi bride has been reunited with her mother in Iraq, reports say.

Linda Wenzel, 16, fled her hometown of Pulsnitz last year by posing as her mom and boarding a flight to Turkey, en route to Syria. She was smuggled into Iraq, married a Chechen fighter and ended up in Mosul.

In July, she was captured in Mosul by Iraqi soldiers who dragged the filthy, dazed and wounded teen from the former ISIS stronghold.

Her mother, Katharina Wenzel, 48, and her other daughter, Miriam, flew to Baghdad to visit Linda, now 17 years old, according to Central European News.

German public TV station Das Erste captured the reunion at a Baghdad police station, where the so-called “Belle of Mosul” and her mother stared at each other awkwardly for a few seconds before finally embracing.

Katharina gave her daughter a cuddly toy with a Christmas hat to remind her of better times they spent as a family during the holiday season at their home in Germany.

“I do not know how I came up with the stupid idea to go to the Islamic State. I have ruined my life,” Linda, wearing a headscarf and an Islamic kaftan robe, told her mother.

Linda claims she never fought for ISIS, but German intelligence and security sources say that according to Iraqi officials, she remains unrepentant.

Next month, she will face trial in Baghdad because Iraqi authorities are refusing to extradite her to Germany. According to the source inside Germany’s security apparatus, there is no extradition agreement between the two countries.

Iraqi Prime Minsiter Haider al-Abadi has said that Linda might face the death penalty. “You know teenagers under certain laws, they are accountable for their actions especially if the act is a criminal activity when it amounts to killing innocent people,” he said in September.

The threat of a trial in Baghdad and a possible long prison sentence — or even capital punishment — has Linda’s dad worried.

“I want so much that my Linda comes home again healthy. I will always be there for her,” Reiner Wenzel said. “I fear for her. The authorities absolutely have to bring her to Germany so that she can get a fair trial.”",-1.720000,8.720000,0.0,December,https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/germany-isis.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
Trump on possible Flynn pardon: ‘We’ll see what happens’,2017-12-10,https://nypost.com/2017/12/15/trump-on-possible-flynn-pardon-well-see-what-happens/,"President Trump refused to say Friday if he would consider pardoning former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty in the probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.

“I don’t want to talk about pardons for Michael Flynn yet. We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters. “Let’s see, I can say this: When you look at what’s gone on with the FBI and the Justice Department, people are very, very angry.”

The president also refused to say when he learned that Flynn lied to the feds.

“You know the answer,” Trump said. “How many times has that question been asked?”

Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe about conversations with Russia’s ambassador. He also disclosed that he is cooperating with Mueller’s office.

Trump, who was on his way to speak at the FBI National Academy on Friday in Quantico, Va., said it is “sad” what has happened to the agency.

He alluded to newly revealed edits to former FBI Director James Comey’s 2016 statement on the investigation into Hillary Clinton.

“It is very sad when you look at those documents and how they’ve done that is very, very disgraceful and you have a lot of angry people that are seeing it. It’s a very sad thing to watch, I will tell you that,” he said.

Mueller reassigned FBI agent Peter Strzok over the summer after it was revealed he sent anti-Trump texts while he was part of the FBI team probing Clinton’s emails last year.

In his texts to senior FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Strzok called the president an “idiot” and an “enormous douche.”

Trump also reiterated that “there was no collusion” between his campaign and the Russian government, adding the recent revelations prove his claim that the Clinton probe was “rigged.”

The White House said newly revealed FBI records show there is “extreme bias” against Trump among senior leadership at the FBI.

Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News that edits to Comey’s statement on Clinton’s private email server and text messages from a top agent critical of Trump are “deeply troubling.”

“There is extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton at the time,” Gidley said, adding that Trump maintains confidence in the FBI’s rank-and-file and the Justice Department.

“It’s a shame what happened with the FBI, but we’re going to rebuild the FBI,” Trump said. “It’ll be bigger and better than ever, but it is very sad when you look at those documents and how they’ve done that is very, very disgraceful and you have a lot of angry people that are seeing it. It’s a very sad thing to watch, I will tell you that.”

Trump also said Roy Moore, who lost the Senate special election in Alabama on Tuesday, should concede.

“I think he should. He tried. I want to support — always, I want to support the person running. We need the seat. We’d like to have the seat,” he said. “I think we’re doing very well on the tax. … It will be the biggest tax decrease, or tax cut, in the history of our country.”

Moore has refused to concede after the shocking upset victory by Democrat Doug Jones, saying his campaign was still awaiting uncounted ballots.

Trump also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin said some “very nice things about what I’ve done for this country in terms of the economy, then he said also some negative things in terms of what’s going on elsewhere.”

He said the main topic of their conversation was North Korea and that he wants Putin’s help dealing with the rogue regime.

GOP lawmakers tweak tax bill to get Rubio back on board,2017-12-10,https://nypost.com/2017/12/15/gop-lawmakers-tweak-tax-bill-to-get-rubio-back-on-board/,"GOP lawmakers on Friday expanded the Child Tax Credit that helps low-income families in a bid to persuade Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to support their tax reform bill after he threatened to vote no over the issue.

South Dakota Rep. Kristi Noem, one of the Republicans working on a final bill, predicted that Rubio would get back on board after the change.

“I believe that we’re in a good spot and should be able to earn his support” she told The Washington Post

A Rubio spokeswoman said he was eyeballing the final measure and would decide whether it met his demands..

Congressional Republicans were set to unveil their sweeping tax package Friday amid uncertainty about whether they have the votes to pass it in the Senate and deliver to President Trump his first major legislative victory.

At the White House, Trump said he was confident that Congress would pass the legislation as early as next week.

The package would give generous tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest Americans — Trump among them — and more modest tax cuts to low- and middle-income families.

“We’re putting in a tremendous child tax credit and it is increasing on a daily basis,” Trump said. “I think that we are going to be in a position to pass something as early as next week which will be monumental.”

Members of a House-Senate conference committee were signing the final version of the legislation Friday.

They have been working to blend different versions of the tax package passed by the House and Senate.

Senate Republicans could still pass the package without Rubio’s vote, but they would be cutting it extremely close. An original version was approved 51-49 — with Rubio’s support.

The Senate turmoil erupted after a key faction of House Republicans came out in favor of the bill, boosting its chances.

Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus predicted the vast majority of their members would support the package.

The up-and-down turns came after House and Senate Republican leaders forged an agreement in principle on the most sweeping overhaul of the nation’s tax laws in more than 30 years.

Republican leaders predicted swift passage next week, sending the bill to Trump for his signature.

The tax package would double the per-child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000.

The bill makes a portion of the credit — $1,100 — available to families even if they owe no income tax.

They would receive the money in the form of a tax refund, which is why it’s called a “refundable” tax credit.",7.660000,5.240000,0.0,December,https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/171215-marco-rubio-tax-bill-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
Woman jailed after eviction gets released ahead of 94th birthday,2017-12-10,https://nypost.com/2017/12/15/woman-jailed-after-eviction-gets-released-ahead-of-94th-birthday/,"A 94-year-old Florida woman who was arrested this week when she refused to leave her home after being evicted has been released from jail — and is spending her birthday on Friday as a free woman.

Juanita Fitzgerald, of Eustis, is facing a trespassing charge after she refused to leave the National Church Residences’ Franklin House after falling behind on her rent. A judge released Fitzgerald from the Lake County Jail on her own recognizance Thursday and she was being turned over to a caregiver, Lake County Sheriff’s Office spokesman John Herrell told the Orlando Sentinel.

A police spokesman told the newspaper that officers gave Fitzgerald — who was told of her impending eviction on Monday, days ahead of her 94th birthday on Friday — several options to find alternative housing, but she declined, saying she didn’t want to move. Police were called to the scene after she refused to the building’s lobby. She remained defiant even after officer arrived, according to a police report.

“Unless you carry me out of here, I’m not going anywhere,” according to an arrest report.

Footage of Fitzgerald’s arrest shows the frail nonagenarian screaming as officers take her to jail.

“Ow, God, you’re hurting me,” Fitzgerald said. “Oww!”

One officer can be heard on the bodycam footage released by Eustis police warning Fitzgerald not to scratch him, while another officer said she wasn’t trying to hurt the 5-foot, 100-pound woman. Fitzgerald told WJAX-TV during a jailhouse interview earlier Thursday that she didn’t understand why she was evicted from the residence after eight years, despite court records showing her behind on rent and refusing to pay, according to the station. Fitzgerald said she had bruises on her arms and legs after the arrest.

“Now, can you imagine anybody doing that to an old woman?” she asked the station. “They wouldn’t treat a murderer like they treated me.”

Another resident at the facility said Fitzgerald rebuffed every attempt to help her.

“Everybody here has attempted to help her,” resident Dave Howell told the station. “She refuses all help.”

Fitzgerald, meanwhile, isn’t so worried about her next landing spot.

“I’m a born-again Christian and I’m spirit-filled,” she told WJAX-TV, adding that she’d prefer to return to Franklin House. “Yeah, I’d go back there and live. You know, that’s all the people I know.”",2.600000,8.650000,0.0,December,https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/93-year-old-dragged-by-police_wp1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
Remains found in box tested for possible link to missing brothers,2017-12-10,https://nypost.com/2017/12/15/remains-found-in-box-tested-for-possible-link-to-missing-brothers/,"Investigators are probing a possible link between a box of bones containing the remains of three children found in Montana and the 2010 disappearance of three Michigan brothers.

Michigan State Police confirmed late Thursday that a connection had not yet been made, although additional forensic testing “may provide more answers,” according to a statement obtained by MLive.com.

“There has been nothing previously reported to police linking the brothers to Montana, and it is not known at this time if the remains are from related siblings,” state police officials said. “Further forensic testing has been requested by police in Montana that may provide more answers. Until this testing is completed and additional investigation by law enforcement in Montana occurs, it cannot be determined if these remains belong to the missing Skelton brothers.”

A cleaning crew discovered the box of bones in a shed at a Missoula home in September, KPAX reports.

“Loose teeth,” Missoula Police spokesman Sgt. Travis Walsh said of its contents. “There was what appeared to be bone from a lower jaw and others that were not as specifically described, but I would call them pieces of bones. There were also rocks in this box.”

An anthropology professor at the University of Montana later confirmed the remains to be those of three children, one estimated to be between the ages of 2 and 4, a second between 5 and 8 and a third believed to be between 6 and 10 years old.

Investigators found no evidence of a crime occurring at the property, KPAX reports, and the children’s identities, as well as their cause and manner of death, remains under investigation, according to the station.

In 2010, three boys from Morenci, Mich., disappeared after they were last seen in their father’s backyard on Thanksgiving, MLive.com reported. Andrew, Alexander and Tanner Skelton were 9, 7 and 5 years old at the time.

John Skelton, the boys’ father, was later convicted of unlawful imprisonment of the boys, but never revealed their location to authorities. He was sentenced in 2011 to 1o to 15 years in prison, according to the Associated Press.

Skelton insisted that he gave his three sons to an unidentified group in an attempt to protect them from their mother, who had sole custody of the boys after the couple divorced. A judge blasted his version of events as “ridiculous” and untruthful, while the Morenci Police Chief Larry Weeks said he would pursue murder charges at the time.

“We want resolution now, but it’s a marathon, not a sprint,” Weeks said. “I believe that John Skelton murdered those boys.”

Tanya Zuvers, the boys’ mother, acknowledged the potential break in the case on Facebook late Thursday.

“This information has just been presented to our family within the last several hours,” Zuvers wrote. “We are processing it and hopeful that we will have answers soon. We are thankful for your thoughts and prayers.”",8.030000,6.660000,0.0,December,https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/171215-michigan-mystery-bag-bones-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200,2017-12-15,2017-12-15
